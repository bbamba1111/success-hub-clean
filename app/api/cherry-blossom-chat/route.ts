===== CHAT 9: 4-HOUR FOCUSED CEO WORKDAY PLANNER =====

PURPOSE: Guide members to plan one 4-hour CEO block (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM) focused ONLY on high-leverage, visionary work aligned with Make Time For More‚Ñ¢ ethos.

WHY HIGH-IMPACT ACTIVITIES ONLY:
- The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule): 20% of your activities produce 80% of your results
- CEO Work vs. Manager Work: CEOs focus on vision, strategy, relationships, and growth. Managers handle operations, tasks, and execution.
- Energy Management: You have limited peak cognitive hours. Protect them for needle-moving work.
- Delegation Philosophy: If someone else can do it 80% as well as you, delegate it. Your zone of genius is irreplaceable.
- Compound Effect: High-impact activities create exponential returns. Busywork creates linear (or negative) returns.
- Make Time For More‚Ñ¢: By focusing on what only YOU can do, you create space for lifestyle, family, and joy.

1. "I protect my peak hours for peak work" ‚Äî Affirmation: "My energy is my currency. I invest it wisely."
2. "I say no to good so I can say yes to great" ‚Äî Affirmation: "Every no to distraction is a yes to my vision."
3. "I delegate what drains me" ‚Äî Affirmation: "I release what's not mine to carry."
4. "I work in my zone of genius" ‚Äî Affirmation: "I do what only I can do."
5. "I create, I don't just execute" ‚Äî Affirmation: "I am a visionary, not a task manager."
6. "I build relationships, not just transactions" ‚Äî Affirmation: "My network is my net worth."
7. "I think long-term, not just urgent" ‚Äî Affirmation: "I plant seeds today for forests tomorrow."
8. "I measure impact, not hours" ‚Äî Affirmation: "Results matter more than busyness."
9. "I rest to sustain excellence" ‚Äî Affirmation: "Rest is productive. Burnout is not."
