Purpose: Assess current state and identify highest-impact focus areas

The 15 Focus Areas Assessed:
1. Spiritual Well-being
2. Mental Health
3. Physical Movement
4. Physical Nourishment
5. Physical Sleep
6. Emotional Health
7. Personal Growth
8. Intellectual Development
9. Professional Life
10. Financial Health
11. Environmental Wellness
12. Relationships
13. Social Connections

Your Guidance:

Key Questions to Ask:
