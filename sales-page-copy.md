## Hi, I'm Barbara

I'm here to help you reconnect to your original entrepreneurial intentions and prioritize what matters most to you — because I know…

## You Didn't Leave Your High-Stress Role to Recreate Burnout in Your Business

You left for work-life balance, time-freedom, and success on your terms.

But somewhere along the way, those unhealthy hustle habits crept in —

---

## But It's Not Your Fault...

### The Truth???

You left the high-stress job — but you didn't leave **hustle culture**.  
You brought it with you.

You inherited a broken blueprint — one built for corporate survival, not entrepreneurial fulfillment.

A model that rewards exhaustion, glorifies over-effort, and quietly demands that you sacrifice everything that makes life worth living.

And those ingrained hustle habits? They're still running the show — keeping you from the peace, presence, and prosperity you started your business for.

Because — like so many visionary founders — you were never taught how to structure your business in a way that honors your time, energy, and values.

### Until Now…

---

## Tap Into The Spiritual & Scientific Side of Life & Business Success

### The Spiritual Side

Everything you desire — already exists in energetic form. You just have to learn how to build inside it.

At Make Time For More™, we combine spiritual alignment with scientific habit-building so you can retrain your mind, body, life and business to operate in the same frequency as the life you're calling in.

You begin by **"ASKING"** aka planting your spiritual seed: your **28-Day Desired Work-Lifestyle Intention** — inspired by Matthew 7:7: *"Ask, and it shall be GIVEN to you."*

Through the **GIV•EN™ Framework** — Gratitude, Invitation, Vision, Embody, Nurture — you nurture that intention (spiritual seed) daily, aligning your energy, emotions, and actions with divine rhythm.

This is the spiritual practice of co-creation — where faith, frequency, and focus converge to magnetize your desired reality.

---

### The Scientific Side

While the spiritual work activates your higher energy, the science makes your transformation tangible.

Through **neuroscience, habit science, hormonal regulation, and quantum alignment**, you'll rewire the physiological patterns that fuel stress, scarcity, and survival.

Each practice in the Work-Life Balance Business Model™ and SOP is designed to regulate your nervous system, retrain your Reticular Activating System (RAS) for focus and flow, and balance your hormones for sustainable energy and clarity.

---

## The Six Ingrained Hustle Habits We Replace

1️⃣ **Waking up reactive** → Morning GIV•EN Routine  
2️⃣ **Sitting all day on caffeine** → 30-min movement window  
3️⃣ **Skipping lunch** → Extended Healthy Hybrid Lunch  
4️⃣ **Working endlessly** → 4-hour Focused CEO Workday (stop at 5 PM)  
5️⃣ **Delaying joy** → Quality of Lifestyle Experiences  
6️⃣ **Pushing through exhaustion** → Power Down & Unplug

**Every Monday you practice the cure.**

---

## The Solution: The Work-Life Balance Business Model

### Work Less, Live More:

Experience the freedom of working smarter—not harder with:

**The 4-Day Workweek:** Work Monday through Thursday to reclaim Fridays and Saturdays for personal passions and relaxation.

**The 4-Hour Workday:** Dedicate focused time to high-value, leveraged income-generating activities (1:00 PM–5:00 PM).

**152 Hours of Weekly Time Freedom:** A 16-hour part-time workweek gives you the flexibility to prioritize relationships, health, and well-being.

**Unstructured Evenings:** After 5 PM, enjoy personal passions, hobbies, and relationships "guilt free" without work obligations.

**Why It Matters:** This time freedom model protects your time, fosters creativity, and ensures balance while allowing you to experience holistic success without burnout.

---

## The 4 Problems We Solve

**1) Freedom… but still overworking**  
60–80 hour weeks, always "on," never unplugging. Freedom vanished.

**2) No work-life balance or time freedom**  
Health suffers. Relationships strain. Joy gets postponed.

**3) Trying to outwork AI**  
Working harder to "stay ahead" leads to exhaustion—not leverage.

**4) High failure rate in the Age of AI**  
Entrepreneurship is the new normal—but most burn out, give up, or get displaced.

### What if you didn't have to hustle to win?

What if there was a better way?

What if you could harmonize work and life?
